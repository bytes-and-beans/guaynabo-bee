{#  SuperContent is a all purpose content type used in most of the entries and 
    pages on the site.

        FYI: The 'Retcon' plugin may be very usefull to decorate the various tags
        produced by Redactor fields.
        
        superContent started as just a Matrix with a couple of blocks as an
        attempt to get around some of Redactor's limitiations.  
        Now it's become "featureCreep.twig".  
        I would nuke the whole thing and start from scratch with this, but it is 
        already in and kinda needs to be supported, if I don't plan on re-porting 
        whole site again.

        Matrix field with the following block types

        .... Whew, this is gonna be it's whole sub-project.
        There are nine blocks, some of which are wierd sub-behaviors and pull in 
        third party libraries that I'll need to install..

    requred Vars
        superfield: the matrix field being rendered.
            you may want to explicity pass this via with {superField: the field here}
            to be absoulute sure there will be no conflicts.
